Philemon Troy and the Student Body Pageant is an adventure//dating game in the vein of Leisure suit Larry. The version on GitHub will be censored to comply with TOS, the code and functionality will be the same as the full version, though. Someone would probably give this game a Mature 17+ rating.

Will not work on Godot 3.0! Tested and playing fine with 2.3 and 2.4 beta.

TODO next:

Features:

Move player around with mouseclick (be the testcube!)
UI hover effects
Dialogue system based on json
simple object and character collision
Manual:

leftclick to initiate conversation
ESC to exit dialogue
CTRL+Q to quit game
Phone UI is just a placeholder, no way to close down, you´ll need to CTRL+Q
